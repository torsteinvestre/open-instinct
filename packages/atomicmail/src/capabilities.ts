/**
 * The hosted Atomic Mail tools this package registers, and the capability each call needs.
 * The policy engine checks the capability against the caller's tier, so this table decides
 * what a partner or a friend can do through the agent's inbox. Reading is owner only.
 * Sending is owner only too, and asks first for a partner.
 *
 * A tool that is not listed is not registered, so a tool the server adds later stays off
 * until someone tags it here. Four hosted tools are left out on purpose:
 * - `jmap_request` and `run_preset` can read, send and delete in one call. A per-tool
 *   capability cannot describe that, the same reason `packages/apps` warns about
 *   COMPOSIO_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL.
 * - `search` and `fetch` repeat `search_messages` and `read_message` for other clients.
 * - `list_agents` and `help` are for the person setting up the connection, not the model.
